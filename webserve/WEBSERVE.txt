This document contains details regarding how to configure a server with OpenDMTP
and a web server to provide you with your personal web-based mobile GPS tracking 
service.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1] Notes:

This configuration uses Google Maps to display the GPS data points.  Before you can
use the Google Maps JavaScript to display maps, you must first apply for an "API Key"
from Google.  Visit "http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html" for more 
information. (Note: Make sure you fully comply with Google Map's 'Terms of Use').

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2] Install/Configure the Server:

1) Download and build the latest OpenDMTP Java server:
   Copy the OpenDMTP Java server project 'zip' file to the server and unwrap in a 
   convenient location.  Follow the directions in the README.txt file for building 
   and installation instructions.
    
2) Configure your web server:
   Install and configure your web server (Apache is a good choice).  No special 
   configuration is necessary other than serving static HTML files.  You may wish
   to add other restrictions as necessary to prevent unwanted access.
   
3) Install "track.html":
   From the OpenDMTP Java server project directory, copy the file 
   "webserve/track.html" to the document root of your web server:

    % cp ./webserve/track.html <web_server_doc_root>/.
    
   Replace <web_server_doc_root> with the location of the web server document root.

4) Edit "track.html" and insert the Google Maps API key:
   Visit "http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html" and apply for a "Google Maps
   API Key".  Place this key in the appropriate area in the "track.html" file 
   (search for "PLACE_KEY_HERE"). [Note: "track.html" has only been tested on Firefox
   v1.5.0 and IE v6.0.  If you are using another browser, then additional changes 
   may be necessary.]
   
5) While editing "track.html", make sure that the file indicated by the JavaScript
   variable "DATA_CSV_FILE" correctly matches the name of the file on the server  
   where your device data will be stored.

6) Start the OpenDMTP Java server:
   From the OpenDMTP directory, start the Java server DMTP service.

   Linux:
      % bin/server.sh -storedir=<web_server_doc_root>
   Windows-XP:
      > bin\server.bat "-storedir=<web_server_doc_root>"
   
   Replace <web_server_doc_root> with the location of the web server document root.  
   This command will start the DMTP service to listen for client TCP/UDP connections 
   port 31000 and will write received client event data in CSV format to the file 
   "<AccountID>_<Device_ID>.csv" in your web server document root directory (which 
   will later be accessed by 'track.html').

   Important Note: The current flat-file data store implementation of the server will 
   continue to collect GPS events and append them in the appropriate data files.  No 
   provision is currently in place to trim this file of old obsolete GPS events, so 
   you will need to perform this task manually.  This can be done in a nightly 'cron' 
   job on the system by simply deleting, or renaming, the file(s) on a nightly basis.

6) Update your firewall/router to forward inbound requests from port 80 (HTTP) and 
   31000 (DMTP) to your server. (If necessary, you may wish to add other restrictions 
   to prevent unwanted access.)

7) Test the routing from outside your local network to your server.  See if you can 
   specify the URL of your server from an outside browser and get a web page.  Try 
   to 'telnet' to port 31000 on your server to see if you can connect:
   
     % telnet <my_server_host> 31000
     
   If you are unable to connect (ie. "connection refused", "could not open...", 
   etc.), then your router or firewall still needs to be configured.  (make sure
   you are trying to connect from "outside" your private network.)
   
   If you are assigned a dynamic IP address from your Internet service provider,
   you may wish to look into using a service like www.dyndns.com to provide a 
   static name to your dynamic IP address (see http://www.dyndns.com/services).
   Most popular broad-band routers will already support these service internally 
   (ie. NetGear, Linksys, ...).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3] Install/Configure the Client:

1) Download the latest version of either the OpenDMTP C client, or J2ME client:
   Unwrap the select OpenDMTP client project 'zip' file in a convenient location.

2) Build and install the client project according to the accompanying documentation.
   (The OpenDMTP C client project has some additional documentation for configuring
   the C client for use with a web server which can be helpful here).

3) Configure the selected OpenDMTP client to point to the hostname of your server.
   
4) Start the client application on your device and monitor the connection with the
   server.  If the client has problems connecting to the server, see the 
   "Troubleshooting" section below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4] Testing the System:

At this point place the client device in your vehicle and try driving around.  You 
should see the device generate events and attempt to forward them to your server.

Once back home, you can try viewing the data on a web-browser by visiting your GPS 
tracking web page:

   http://<my_domain_name>/track.html
   
Where <my_domain_name> is the domain-name or IP address of your webserver.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5] Troubleshooting:

Problem - The client is unable to connect to the server:
- Do you have a valid SIM card (with proper data plan) installed in your GPRS
  modem, or phone?
- Are you in an area that has GPRS coverage?
- Is the host and port set properly to reference your server?
- Does your firewall/router properly route inbound request to port 31000 to your
  server?
- If you are using the C client, refer to the documentation in the OpenDMTP C 
  client package for additional troubleshooting help.

Problem - The client can connect to the server, but the client does not appear 
to be receiving GPS data.
- Is the GPS receiver properly attached to the device?  Is the serial port 
  properly attached and configured?  Or if you are using a wireless Bluetooth GPS
  receiver, has the phone or device been properly configured with the appropriate
  passkey of the GPS receiver?
- If you are using th C client, refer to the documentation in the OpenDMTP C 
  client package for additional troubleshooting help.
